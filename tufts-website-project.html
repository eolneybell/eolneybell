          I was a member of a team that was tasked with building a website to represent Tufts' Human Factors Program. Of course,
            we had a number of requirements that we had to fulfill. Following human factors procedure quite closely,
            we began the development process with desk-based research, which involved reviewing competing sites, identifying our stakeholders, and producing surveys. From there we moved to 
            interviews in order solidify our user needs and product requirements. After laying out the information architecture, we proceeded to wireframe and populate the site with
            content, before conducting user tests and expert reviews. Though I was thoroughly involved in every step of the process, I took a particular lead in developing survey questions, creating personas, 
            determining our needs and requirements, and moderating expert reviews with some of Tufts' human factors professors.

    <p class="paragraph">Work commenced on the project with a competitive analysis of other academic websites. We took notes on these sites’ contents (e.g. faculty info), the various UX features they incorporated (particularly UI elements), and qualitatively assessed their usability.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Our next endeavor was to conduct initial user research. We administered questionnaires to various user groups, such as faculty, alumni, and current students, and used the results to compile a list of user needs and website requirements. Our findings from these activities were then distilled into personas representing the major stakeholders.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">A formal team meeting followed the completion of the initial user research, and after some discussion and brainstorming, work began on the site’s information architecture and design. Mockups were produced in Sketch, and then implemented in the functional first draft of the website. The site in this stage was then examined through expert reviews as well as usability tests, which consisted of participants who were representative of our users. With these methods, we were able to produce actionable improvements to the website.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">After analyzing the results of our research, we designed a new iteration of the site. We then presented our findings to the professors who commissioned the project and launched the site at sites.tufts.edu/humanfactors.</p>
