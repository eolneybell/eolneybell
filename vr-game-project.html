        <div class="project-body">The goal of this project (involving me and two other human factors students) was to design
         and develop a physics lesson in virtual reality, and to conduct a study measuring its effectiveness at teaching this lesson.
         To gain guidance on the teaching effectiveness of gamified lessons, we conducted an expert review of online physics and virtual reality games. 
         We wrote and administered a questionnaire to introductory physics students, developed personas in order to get into our target usersâ€™ shoes, and eventually
         conducted tests with our game to measure its usability and educational value.
