This website (https://eolneybell.github.io/) consists of the resume and biography of a fictitious person named John H. Pumpernickel. Links to the resume and biography portions of the site can be accessed by clicking on links in the lower left corner of the homepage. The site could certainly be improved with more time - I may eventually turn it into a real portfolio for myself and try to improve it visually. The color scheme isn't very attractive, but it is meant to reflect the flag of Wesphalia in Germany.


1. While I haven't conducted any extremely thorough tests of the website's functionality, I believe that  it generally functions as intended. I did notice however that highlighting certain elements of the homepage produces some unusual graphical glitches. I don't know why this is, but I assume it is relatively harmless. I have also attempted to follow all the guidelines associated with this assignment.

2. I haven't collaborated with anyone on this assignment, but I have 'discussed' it with you on Piazza, and of course looked up resolutions to problems online.

3. It's hard to say, but I'd estimate that I spent /at least/ 6 hours on this assignment in total, distributed over the course of several days.
