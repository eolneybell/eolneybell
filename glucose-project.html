          This very small project is documentation of some of the usability testing that I have been involved in. Three participants were asked to use a glucose 
            meter to perform three tasks, all of which were determined to be essential to the process of monitoring blood glucose levels. The testing yielded a document containing
            general findings as well as very broad suggestions for improving the usability of the glucose meter.

    <p class="paragraph"> Our team identified three critical tasks with which to test the device and conceived of follow-up questions for each task. The three tasks were: <ul class="list"><li class="listitem">Task 1: This is a glucose meter that you can buy in any local pharmacy. Imagine youâ€™ve just purchased one for the first time and are about to open the box up and take your first reading. For your first task, please determine the purpose of each of the major device components. </li><li class="listitem">Task 2: Please take a blood glucose reading using the test solution in lieu of your own blood. </li><li class="listitem">Task 3: Imagine you have been using this device for several weeks now. Please read out the results of your past readings. </li></ul></p>

    <p class="paragraph">After analyzing the results from the 3 usability tests, our team identified several opportunities for design improvement that apply to the TRUEresult blood glucose monitoring kit. The suggested design changes are outlined in the following images</p>
