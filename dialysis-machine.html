          I worked with two other students to develop a concept for a peritoneal dialysis machine designed to free
            patients from the normally captive experience of dialysis treatment. The concept included a backpack to contain the dialysis machine
            plus a mobile app and wrist controller for monitoring vitals, keeping track of treatments, and communicating with health care professionals. 
            Among the human factors processes involved in this project, building FMEAs and conducting cognitive walkthroughs with dialysis patients were particularly educational.

    <p class="paragraph">After some initial background research on dialysis and kidney disease, my group conducted interviews with patients to discover their pain points and general experiences with peritoneal dialysis. From there we were able to generate personas, which helped us form a sense of our users and document their needs in a thorough and organized fashion.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Based on our background research and patient interviews, we prepared descriptions of a set of expected use environments (e.g. the home, commercial aircraft, etc.) for the device. With these use environments in mind, we created a list of user interface specifications to ensure the versatility and usability of the device in numerous contexts. These user interface specifications, in turn, provided guidance for the device’s design.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Because we were developing a portable medical device that people relied on to live, it was important to conduct a use failure modes and effects analysis (u-FMEA). This helped us identify use errors associated with the device and the level of harm these errors could inflict. We followed up this process by designing risk mitigations for each of the potential failure modes we identified.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Our research led us to produce preliminary designs for backpack meant to carry the device as well as a wrist controller. We also designed mockups for a phone app and the wrist controller’s electronic interface.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Upon drafting a series of mockups, we conducted cognitive walkthroughs with participants who were representative of our users – namely dialysis patients and healthcare professionals. With the feedback from these activities we documented and presented areas of our design that needed further refinement as well as those that were successful. We did not continue to iterate on our designs at this point, as we had achieved our goal of developing the concept and running initial formative evaluations.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The purpose of this project was to develop the concept within a week. Therefore, our mockups were not iterated upon and instead simply presented as a first draft along with an analysis of their usability.</p>
